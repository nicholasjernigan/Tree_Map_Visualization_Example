Tree_Map_Visualitzation_Example README

This repository showcases an example visualization project I completed recently.

July_Spend_by_Category.csv is the sample data. It has been pre-cleaned and randomzied for privacy purposes (the cleaning was done in python and can be demonstrated in a less public enviornment).

TreeMapVisualization.py is the code to create the tree map and bar graph. The code demonstrates multiple iterations
of the tree map, since it took a few different methods to get it looking right.

Total_Spend.png is the data in a bar chart.

Spend_Percent_by_Category.png is the tree map.
